# Iterating Over Elements

Iteration means going through elements one by one in a sequence. With lists, we can access each element systematically using different methods.

The most common way to iterate through a list is using a `for` loop:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Output:

```python
apple
banana
orange
```

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a program that receives a list as input (**given**), and prints a new list containing only the words **longer than** 5 characters
