# The FizzBuzz Function

## Challenge

**Easy**

Add a function named `fizzbuzz` that gets one number (`int`) as an argument, and:

* If the number is divisible by 3, return `"Fizz"`.
* If the number is divisible by 7, return `"Buzz"`.
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 7, return `"FizzBuzz"`.
* If none of the above conditions are met, return the number itself **in a string format**.

After the function:

* Get input and cast it to int
* Call the function `fizzbuzz` with the input number
* Print the output of the function
