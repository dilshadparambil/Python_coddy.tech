# Accessing List Elements Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a function named `sum_elements` that receives a list as an argument and prints the sum of all the elements in the list.

To iterate over a list, use the `len()` function inside the `range()` function:

```
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
for i in range(len(my_list)):
	# Access elements using my_list[i]
```

Use this method to access each element of the list, add them together, and print the total sum.
