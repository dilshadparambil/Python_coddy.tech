# Range Function Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Beginner**

Create a program that performs the following tasks using `range()`:

1. Print all numbers between 30 to 80 that are divisible by 4
2. Print the first 8 odd numbers starting from 15
3. Count backwards from 50 to 10, showing only numbers divisible by 5
4. Find the product of all numbers from 1 to 30 that are divisible by 3

When printing a number use the following code to print:
```
print(num, end=", ")
```
This will not create a new line after the number, instead it will add `,`
