# Game Overview

FizzBuzz is a simple and classic programming game often used to teach basic logic and control flow. The game involves iterating through numbers from 1 up to a specified limit. For each number:

* If the number is divisible by 3, the program outputs "Fizz."
* If the number is divisible by 7, it outputs "Buzz."
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 7, it outputs "FizzBuzz."
* Otherwise, it simply outputs the number.

This game is an excellent way to practice using loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic.
