# Arguments Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. The program should take two inputs: the length and width of the rectangle.

Define a function that accepts two arguments (length and width), calculates the area of the rectangle (length * width), and prints the result.

After defining the function, prompt the user for the length and width inputs, and then call your function with these inputs.

Remember: Define your function before calling it in your code.
