# Numbers

**Variables** are containers that hold data values. They are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.

In short, a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable.

Each variable has a unique **name** and a **value** that can be of different types. Python is capable of automatically detecting the variable type, which makes coding more efficient.

To initialize a variable, we use the following **format**:

```python
variable_name = value
```

Let's take a look at the different types of numbers:

`int` - whole number, such as `1` or `-2`.

`float` - real number, such as `1.32` or `0.98`.

For example:

To initialize a variable of type `int` with the name `a` and the value `3`:

```python
a = 3
```

To initialize a variable of type `float` with the name `b` and the value `13.2`:

```python
b = 13.2
```

## Challenge

**Beginner**

Write code that initializes a variable named `var` with the value `5`.
