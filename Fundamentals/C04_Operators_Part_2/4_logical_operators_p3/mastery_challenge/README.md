# Logical Operators Part 3 Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

You're helping a weather app determine suitable outdoor activities based on weather conditions. Create a program that uses logical operations to determine if certain activities are possible.  

Initialize the following variables:  

- `is_sunny` with the value `True`
- `temperature` with the value `25`
- `wind_speed` with the value `10`
- `water_temperature` with the value `22`  

Write the following logical expressions to determine if:

- `can_go_hiking`: It's sunny AND temperature is above 15째C AND wind speed is below 20 km/h.  
- `can_go_swimming`: It's sunny AND temperature is above 20째C AND water temperature is above 18째C.  
- `cannot_go_outside`: It's NOT sunny OR temperature is below 10째C OR wind speed is above 30 km/h.
