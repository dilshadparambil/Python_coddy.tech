# If - Else Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Beginner**

You are given a code which gets as input a number that indicates the temperature in Celsius and stores it in a variable named `temperature`.

**Note**: Don't modify the first line of the code. 

Your task is to initialize variable `weather` based on the following conditions:

* `"Freezing"` if `temperature` is below `0`,
* `"Cold"` if `temperature` is between `0` and `15` (including 0 and 15).
* `"Mild"` if `temperature` is between `16` and `25` (including 16 and 25)
* `"Hot"` otherwise

*Check the test cases to see all the inputs and the expected outputs*
