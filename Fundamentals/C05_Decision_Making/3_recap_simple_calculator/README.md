# Recap - Simple Calculator

## Challenge

**Beginner**

You are given a code which gets as input two numbers `n1` and `n2` and a character `op`.

**Note**: we will learn in next lessons how to get input from the user, currently just don't touch the three first lines.

The possible values for `op` are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'/'` and `'*'`

Your task is to set the variable `result` based on the conditions:

* if `op` is `'+'`, set `result` with `n1 + n2`.
* if `op` is `'-'`, set `result` with `n1 - n2`.
* if `op` is `'/'`, set `result` with `n1 / n2`.
* if `op` is `'*'`, set `result` with `n1 * n2`.
