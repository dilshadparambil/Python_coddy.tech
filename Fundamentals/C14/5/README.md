# Total And Average

## Challenge

**Easy**

Handle the option to calculate the total and average expense (3).

If the expenses list is empty, output:

`No expenses recorded yet.`

Otherwise, output the list in the following format:

```
Total expense: 600.0
Average expense: 200.0
```

Assuming the expenses entered before were `300`, `200` and `100`. (In that order!)
