# Sequence Operators Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a program that receives a list of numbers as input and prints a new list that:

1. Contains the original list followed by its reverse
2. Has the first element of the original list inserted at the beginning and the last element inserted at the end
3. Repeats this entire sequence twice

For example:

`1 2 3 â†’ [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3]`
