# List Methods Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a function named `combine_and_filter` that receives 2 arguments:

* First argument is a list of numbers
* Second argument is an integer threshold value

The function should:

1. Filter out all numbers that are less than or equal to the threshold value
2. Sort the remaining numbers
3. Return the resulting list

For example, calling `combine_and_filter([1, 5, 3, 2, 7, 4], 3)` should return `[4, 5, 7]`.
