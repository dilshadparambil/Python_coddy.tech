# Modulo Operator Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Beginner**

Write a code that initializes three variables, `x`, `y` and `z` with the values `15`, `4`, and `23` (respectively).

After that, initialize the following variables:

* `w` that will hold the result of integer division of `x` by `y` 
* `v` that will hold the result of integer division of `z` by `x`
* `u` that will hold the result of integer division of `z` by `y`

Use the `//` operator for integer division. For example: `7 // 2` equals 3 (not 3.5)


Check out the result and see how different dividends and divisors affect the result.
