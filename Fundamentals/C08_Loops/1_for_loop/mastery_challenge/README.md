# For Loop Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Beginner**

Write a program that counts the number of even numbers between 10 and 50 (inclusive).

Use a for loop and an if statement to check if each number is even.

Store the count in a variable called `count_even`.

Remember, you can check if a number is even by using the modulo operator: `number % 2 == 0`
