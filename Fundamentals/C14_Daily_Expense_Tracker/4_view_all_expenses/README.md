# View All Expenses

## Challenge

**Easy**

Handle the option to view all the expenses (2).

If the expenses list is empty, output:

`No expenses recorded yet.`

Otherwise, output the list in the following format:

```
Your expenses:
1. 23.1
2. 35.5
3. 99.99
4. 15.2
```
Assuming the expenses entered before were `23.1`, `35.5`, `99.99` and `15.2`. (In that order!)
