# Everything Together

## Challenge

**Easy**

Now that you've built all the individual functions for the Contact Book, it's time to put them together to create the full program!

**Your Task:**

1. Combine the functions you've created:
   * `display_menu`: Displays the menu options for the user.
   * `add_contact`: Adds a new contact to the Contact Book.
   * `view_contact`: Displays details for a specific contact.
   * `edit_contact`: Updates an existing contact's information.
   * `delete_contact`: Removes a contact from the Contact Book.
   * `list_all_contacts`: Displays all the contacts in the Contact Book.
2. Create a dictionary called `contact_book` to store the contacts.
3. Write a loop that:
   * Displays the menu using `display_menu`.
   * Accepts user input for the menu choice.
   * Calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.
   * Continues until the user selects the option to exit the program.

**Expected Behavior:**

When you run the program, it should:

1. Show a menu of options for the user to choose from.
2. Allow the user to interact with the Contact Book by calling the appropriate function.
3. Exit the program cleanly when the user selects the "Exit" option.

This final step combines all the knowledge you've gained into a fully functioning Contact Book application. Enjoy seeing your hard work come together! ðŸŽ‰
