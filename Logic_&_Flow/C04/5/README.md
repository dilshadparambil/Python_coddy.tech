# Delete Contact

## Challenge

**Easy**

The next step is to create the `delete_contact` function. This function will allow users to remove a specific contact from the Contact Book.

**Your Task:**

1. Create a function named `delete_contact` that takes one argument: `contact_book` (a dictionary).
2. Get input for the contact's name that the user wants to delete.
3. Check if the name exists in the `contact_book`:
   * If it exists, remove the contact from the dictionary.
   * Print: `"Contact deleted successfully!"`.
4. If the contact does not exist, print: `"Contact not found!"`.
