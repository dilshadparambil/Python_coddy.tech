# Display Menu

## Challenge

**Easy**

In this project, we will build a Contact Book application step by step by breaking it into small, manageable functions. The first step is to create a **display_menu** function.

Create a function named `display_menu` that prints the main menu options for the Contact Book.

The menu should include the following options:

* Add Contact
* View Contact
* Edit Contact
* Delete Contact
* List All Contacts
* Exit

This function will be the starting point of the program, helping users navigate through the options.

*Check the test case for the output format!*
