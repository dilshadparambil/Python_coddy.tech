# Modifying Dictionaries Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a function named `update_inventory` that takes three parameters: `inventory_dict` (a dictionary), `item` (a string), and `quantity` (an integer). The function should update the `inventory_dict` with the new `item` and `quantity`. If the item already exists in the inventory, its quantity should be increased by the given amount. If the item does not exist, a new item should be added with the given quantity. The function should return the updated dictionary.
