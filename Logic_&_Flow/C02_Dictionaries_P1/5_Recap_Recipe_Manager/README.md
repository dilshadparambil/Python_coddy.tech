# Recap - Recipe Manager

Let's recap what we have learned about dictionaries!

## Challenge

**Easy**

You are managing a digital recipe book where each recipe is stored as a dictionary. Each dictionary contains the name of the recipe as the key and a list of ingredients as the value. Your task is to perform several operations to update and manage the recipe book.

1. **Create the Recipe Book:** Create a dictionary named `recipe_book` with the following recipes:
   * `"Pancakes"`: `["flour", "milk", "eggs", "sugar"]`
   * `"Salad"`: `["lettuce", "tomato", "cucumber", "olive oil"]`
2. **Access Ingredients:** Print the list of ingredients for `"Pancakes"`.
3. **Add a New Recipe:** Add a new recipe `"Smoothie"` with the ingredients `["banana", "milk", "honey"]` to the dictionary.
4. **Modify a Recipe:** Add `"blueberries"` to the `"Smoothie"` recipe.
5. **Print All Recipes:** Print the entire `recipe_book` dictionary to verify the updates.
