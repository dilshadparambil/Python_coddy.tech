# # Ternary Operator Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Write a program that takes a float input `temperature` representing the current temperature in Celsius. Use the ternary operator to determine a warning status based on the temperature:

* If the temperature is above 30°C, the warning should be `"Hot"`.
* If the temperature is 30°C or below, the warning should be `"Normal"`.

The program should output the determined warning status.
