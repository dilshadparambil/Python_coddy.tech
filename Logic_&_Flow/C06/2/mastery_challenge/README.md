# Basic Operations Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a function named `manage_list` that takes three arguments: `list1` (a list of integers), `element_to_append`, and `index_to_remove`. The function should perform the following operations:

1. Append `element_to_append` to the end of `list1`.
2. Attempt to remove the element at index `index_to_remove` from `list1`. If the index is out of range, do nothing.
3. Check if `list1` has more than 3 elements. If it does, return the string `"The list has more than 3 elements"`. Otherwise, return the string `"The list has 3 or fewer elements"`.
