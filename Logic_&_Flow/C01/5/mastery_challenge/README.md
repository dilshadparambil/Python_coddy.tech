# Round Numbers Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a function named `calculate_discount` that takes two parameters:

1. `price`: The original price of an item (float)
2. `discount_percentage`: The discount percentage (float)

The function should:

1. Calculate the discount amount
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price
3. Round the result to 2 decimal places
4. Return the final discounted price

For example, if the original price is $100 and the discount is 20%, the function should return $80.00.
