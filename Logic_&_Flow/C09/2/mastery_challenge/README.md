# Finding Minimum and Maximum Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**
You are given two lists: `temperatures` containing daily temperatures in Fahrenheit, and `humidity` containing daily humidity percentages. Your task is to write a program that:

1. Finds the highest and lowest temperature from the `temperatures` list using `max()` and `min()`.
2. Finds the highest and lowest humidity from the `humidity` list using `max()` and `min()`.
3. Prints the results in a specific format, including units.

Output Format Requirements:

- For temperatures, the value should be followed by `°F` (degree Fahrenheit).
- For humidity, the value should be followed by `%` (percentage sign).
- Each result should be printed on a new line, clearly labeled.

Expected Output Example:

```
Highest temperature: 80°F
Lowest temperature: 65°F
Highest humidity: 70%
Lowest humidity: 50%
```
