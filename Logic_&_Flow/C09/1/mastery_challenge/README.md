# Using Sum Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**
Create a function named `calculate_average_score` that takes a list of scores as an argument. The function should calculate and return the average of these scores. If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

Use the `sum()` function to calculate the total of all scores, and `len()` to get the number of scores. Remember to handle the case where the list might be empty to avoid division by zero.
