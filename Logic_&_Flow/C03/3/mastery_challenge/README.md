# Checking for Keys Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Create a function named `check_inventory`that takes two parameters: `inventory` (a dictionary where keys are item names and values are quantities) and item (a string representing the item to check). The function should:

Check if the `item` is in the `inventory`.
If the item is in stock, return the string: `"<item> is in stock. Quantity: <quantity>".`
If the item is not in stock, return the string: `"<item> is not in stock."`
