# Recursive Functions Part 1 Mastery Challenge

## Challenge

**Easy**

Write a recursive function named `print_sequence` that takes a positive integer `n` as an argument and prints a countdown sequence. For each number from `n` to 1, it should print 'T-minus {number}'. When it reaches 0, it should print 'Blast off!'. For example, if n is 3, the output should be:

```
T-minus 3
T-minus 2
T-minus 1
Blast off!
```
